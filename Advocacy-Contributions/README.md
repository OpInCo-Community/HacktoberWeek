## **Advocacy**
Supporting, defending, or arguing for a certain cause or topic is the act of advocacy.
Action-oriented advocacy entails pushing for change. It can entail doing research on fresh approaches, assembling groups of like-minded individuals, conducting public awareness campaigns, and much more.
It aids in the understanding and support of your cause by others.

Open-source contributing is a vast domain and starting out for the first time may be overwhelming, so we have tried to cater to each part of it by delivering the concepts more simply and inviting the contributors of the fields that will help the audience to contribute and know the tools! (all of it has been included in this repo.)
