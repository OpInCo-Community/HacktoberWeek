Hey Folks! We see that you are up for making some Design contributions for HacktoberWeek. We need your help to make OpInCo more enriched with some of your awesome design contributions!

## **DESIGN**
An outline, sketch, or plan for the shape and construction of a machine, building, or work of art is referred to as a design. It involves developing solutions to meet needs or solve problems for individuals, tangible objects, or more abstract systems. A manifesting algorithm and a platonic instantiation of an object are involved. Implementation/manufacturing is the act of making that object manifest.<br>

*All the fields including [graphic designing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design), [ux testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface_testing),  [designOps](https://www.frog.co/designmind/designops101)  etc fall under designing domain.*<br>



Open-source contributing is a vast domain and starting out for the first time may be overwhelming, so we have tried to cater to each part of it by delivering the concepts more simply and inviting the contributors of the fields that will help the audience to contribute and know the tools! (all of it has been included in this repo.)
