# RESUME SCREENING AND CLASSIFICATION MODEL

**GOAL**

Develop a model classify resumes into predefined categories.
Note: Text classification is an example of supervised machine learning since we train the model with labelled data.

**DATASET**

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhainjeamita/updatedresumedataset?resource=download

**CONTENT**

Data for the case is available in CSV format having 963 rows and 2 columns.

**STEPS TAKEN**

All the required libraries and packages were imported and then the required dataset for the project was loaded. 

*EDA* was carried out to visualize various parameters and the most corelated unigrams and bigrams. 

Data was cleaned also known as *Text Preprocessing*. Text Preprocessing was done using the re function of python and the nltk library which is used for NLP based models. 

Model building was then implemented using different algorithms. 9 different models were used to train and valuate the results. 5 of the used models gave a very high accuracy whereas Dummy Classifier gave the least accuracy of less than 0.1.

**TEXT PREPROCESSING**

The text needs to be transformed to vectors so as the algorithms will be able make predictions. In this case, the **Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF)** weight will be used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents.

After removing punctuation and lower casing the words, importance of a word is determined in terms of its frequency.

TF-IDF is a measure of originality of a word.

**TF** is the number of times a term appears in a particular document.

**IDF** is a measure of how common or rare a term is across the entire corpus of documents.

### Confusion matrix for Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm

By viewing Confusion Matrix it is easily deduced that SGD model is the best model for this project.


**ACCURACIES**
