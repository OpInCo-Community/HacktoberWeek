# MY EXPERIENCE OF HACKTOBER WEEK: DAY 4

Day 4 of <a href="https://github.com/OpInCo-Community/HacktoberWeek" target="_blank">Hacktober Week</a> started with high energy and optimism to learn about <b>technical documentation</b> and <b>Non-code</b> contributions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source#:~:text=Open%20source%20is%20source%20code,or%20content%20of%20the%20product." target="_blank">Open source</a>. Since I'm not <em>tech-savvy</em> I was very excited to learn about Non-code Contributions. 
I also volunteered for anchoring the event, which went great. Initially, I was very anxious and nervous but gradually with the harmony of organizers and my fellow volunteers I blended thoroughly. <br>
Speaker <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrutiguptarkc/" target="_blank">Shruti Gupta</a> had an amazing session about documentation and her experienced realizations about Open Source. 
It was followed by <a href="linkedin.com/in/rahul-sharma18/" target="_blank">Rahul Sharma</a>  who cleared up about good ways and resources for contributions and finally fun and informed hands-on session.

</ul>

### What is Documentation?
Documentation is any communicable material that is used to describe, explain or instruct regarding some attributes of an object, system,or procedure, such as its parts, assembly, installation, maintenance, and use. Some of the examples are user guides, white papers, online help, and quick-reference guides.

<br>There are various styles of documentation-
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APA_style" target="_blank">APA STYLE</a> - It's a method for listing the sources you use so that your readers can identify and find those sources.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style" target="_blank">CMS STYLE</a>-The Chicago Manual of Style Online is a venerable, time-tested guide to style, usage, and grammar in an accessible online form </li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLA_Handbook" target="_blank">MLA STYLE</a>-MLA Documentation Style is a method for listing the sources, identifying and searching sources</li>
<br>

### Need of Documentation
Documentation is essential to quality and process control
There needs to be some level of cohesion so that you don't look sloppy or uninformed. Documentation encourages knowledge sharing, which empowers your team to understand how processes work and what finished projects typically look like.
<br>

### A Good Technical Communication 
<li>Purpose oriented</li>
<li>Audience focused</li>
<li>Accurate</li>
<li>Consistent</li>
<li>Clear n concise</li>
<li>Accessible</li>
<li>Well presented</li>
<br>

### DITA
<a href="https://www.dita-ot.org/dev/">DITA </a> stands for The Darwin Information Typing Architecture. It's an XML data model for authoring, producing, and delivering technical information. This data model consists of a set of design principles that help to create and manage content separately from formatting.
